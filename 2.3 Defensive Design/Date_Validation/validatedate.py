"""
Write a program that asks the user to enter a date in the format DD/MM/YYYY. The program should validate the data in the following ways. The program should output that the date is valid or, if it isnâ€™t, an error displaying which check failed:
There is some input.
The date is 10 characters long.
The date is in the correct format.
The day, month and year are all numbers.
The day and month are not less than 01.
The month is not more than 12.
The year is not less than 1900.
The day is not more than 29 if the month is 02.
The day is not more than 30 for months 02, 04, 06, 09 or 11.
The day is not more than 31 for months 01, 03, 05, 07, 08, 10 or 12.
The day can be 29 for month 02 if the year is exactly divisible by 4.
